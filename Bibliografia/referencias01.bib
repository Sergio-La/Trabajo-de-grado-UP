abstract = "Context
Open source software development (OSSD) process modeling has received increasing interest in recent years. These efforts aim to identify common elements in the development process between multiple open source software (OSS) projects. However, the complexity inherent to OSSD process modeling puts significant demands on the modeling language.
Objective
In this paper, we propose that the Design and Engineering Methodology for Organizations (DEMO) may provide an interesting alternative to develop OSSD process models. DEMO exhibits two unique features within the context of OSSD process modeling. First, DEMO analyzes processes at the ontological level and provides high-level process descriptions, instead of focusing on the implementation level. Second, DEMO studies the communication patterns between human actors, instead of the sequences in which activities are performed.
Method
We investigate the feasibility of using DEMO to construct OSSD process models by means of a case study. DEMO models were constructed to describe the NetBeans Requirements and Release process. In addition, the quality of these DEMO models was evaluated using a quality framework for conceptual modeling.
Results
Our results showed that our DEMO models exhibited a high level of abstraction, thereby reducing the complexity of the OSSD process models. In addition, the evaluation of the models developed in this paper by using the quality framework for conceptual modeling showed that the models were of high quality.
Conclusions
We have shown that the DEMO methodology can be successfully used to model OSSD processes and to obtain abstract and high-quality OSSD process models. However, given some potential drawbacks with respect to understandability and implementability, we primarily propose the use of DEMO within OSSD process modeling as an analysis tool that should be complemented with other techniques and models for communication and reenactment purposes."

The need to bring developers closer to their customer becomes vital for success, especially involving users into the very early stages of software development. This allows detecting flaws of conceptual and design nature, minimize unnecessary development costs, and warrant relevance for customers. This paper presents the CloudTeams methodology and platform that aim to bridge this gap, based on an existing groupware system supporting the notion of collaborative software development."

However, integrating external and internal sources of social capital is challenging and identifying appropriate integration strategies is crucial for the success of such endeavors. This study examines the simultaneous effects of external and internal sources of social capital, in the form of participant and project differences, and examines how they interact to influence OSS project success. We propose a taxonomy of participant differences (language, role, and contribution) and project differences (development environment and connectedness) and postulate their main and moderating effects on project success. Using a four-year panel data set of 329 SourceForge projects, we show that development environment difference has a curvilinear relationship with success and that connectedness reduces the positive impact of role and contribution diversity on project success. We also show that when development environment difference is moderate, the impact of role diversity is the most positive. We present the implications of these findings for theory and practice."

However, small and medium development companies (SMBs) cannot afford to carry out time- and people-intensive tool evaluations for each project, and instead adopt fixed toolsets, thus losing flexibility. To simplify the tool selection process, this article proposes formalizing tool selection as a set of Multiple-Criteria Decision-Making (MCDM) problem, one for each ALM domain. Our domain-parametric recommender takes as inputs a domain, a process definition, and a set of tool evaluation criteria, and yields a ranked list of tools. The approach has been prototyped with the Testing domain and evaluated using a real process and project; the recommendations generated by our approach were quite similar to those of three Testing experts. Pending further evaluation, these results suggest that our approach can generate project-specific tool recommendations with results comparable to those of experts, but at a fraction of the cost."

abstract = "Context: Open source software (OSS) and software ecosystems (SECOs) are two consolidated research areas in software engineering. OSS influences the way organizations develop, acquire, use and commercialize software. SECOs have emerged as a paradigm to understand dynamics and heterogeneity in collaborative software development. For this reason, SECOs appear as a valid instrument to analyze OSS systems. However, there are few studies that blend both topics together. Objective: The purpose of this study is to evaluate the current state of the art in OSS ecosystems (OSSECOs) research, specifically: (a) what the most relevant definitions related to OSSECOs are; (b) what the particularities of this type of SECO are; and (c) how the knowledge about OSSECO is represented. Method: We conducted a systematic mapping following recommended practices. We applied automatic and manual searches on different sources and used a rigorous method to elicit the keywords from the research questions and selection criteria to retrieve the final papers. As a result, 82 papers were selected and evaluated. Threats to validity were identified and mitigated whenever possible. Results: The analysis allowed us to answer the research questions. Most notably, we did the following: (a) identified 64 terms related to the OSSECO and arranged them into a taxonomy; (b) built a genealogical tree to understand the genesis of the OSSECO term from related definitions; (c) analyzed the available definitions of SECO in the context of OSS; and (d) classified the existing modelling and analysis techniques of OSSECOs. Conclusion: As a summary of the systematic mapping, we conclude that existing research on several topics related to OSSECOs is still scarce (e.g., modelling and analysis techniques, quality models, standard definitions, etc.). This situation calls for further investigation efforts on how organizations and OSS communities actually understand OSSECOs."

However, firms still need support for strategic product planning in terms of what to develop internally and what to share as OSS. Existing models accurately capture commoditization in software business, but lack operational support to decide what contribution strategy to employ in terms of what and when to contribute. This study proposes a Contribution Acceptance Process (CAP) model from which firms can adopt contribution strategies that align with product strategies and planning. In a design science influenced case study executed at Sony Mobile, the CAP model was iteratively developed in close collaboration with the firm‚Äôs practitioners. The CAP model helps classify artifacts according to business impact and control complexity so firms may estimate and plan whether an artifact should be contributed or not. Further, an information meta-model is proposed that helps operationalize the CAP model at the organization. The CAP model provides an operational OI perspective on what firms involved in OSS ecosystems should share, by helping them motivate contributions through the creation of contribution strategies. The goal is to help maximize return on investment and sustain needed influence in OSS ecosystems."

abstract = "Context
The power of open source software peer review lies in the involvement of virtual communities, especially users who typically do not have a formal role in the development process. As communities grow to a certain extent, how to organize and support the peer review process becomes increasingly challenging. A universal solution is likely to fail for communities with varying characteristics.
Objective
This paper investigates differences of peer review practices across different open source software communities, especially the ones engage distinct types of users, in order to offer contextualized guidance for developing open source software projects.
Method
Comparative case studies were conducted in two well-established large open source communities, Mozilla and Python, which engage extremely different types of users. Bug reports from their bug tracking systems were examined primarily, complemented by secondary sources such as meeting notes, blog posts, messages from mailing lists, and online documentations.
Results
The two communities differ in the key activities of peer review processes, including different characteristics with respect to bug reporting, design decision making, to patch development and review. Their variances also involve the designs of supporting technology. The results highlight the emerging role of triagers, who bridge the core and peripheral contributors and facilitate the peer review process. The two communities demonstrate alternative designs of open source software peer review and their tradeoffs were discussed.
Conclusion
It is concluded that contextualized designs of social and technological solutions to open source software peer review practices are important. The two cases can serve as learning resources for open source software projects, or other types of large software projects in general, to cope with challenges of leveraging enormous contributions and coordinating core developers. It is also important to improve support for triagers, who have not received much research effort yet."

Specifically, drawing on the lens of Organizational Information Processing Theory (OIPT), we develop a model that explains how committal a structure's ability to manage information impacts FLOSS community performance. Based on archival data drawn from 237 active FLOSS communities, we found that the performance of centralized and decentralized FLOSS communities varied with three conditions tied to information flows: task routineness, uncertainty and task interdependence. Our empirical results support the idea that FLOSS communities performing development tasks that are generally routine, highly interdependent, and generate little contributor uncertainty will perform better under a centralized committal structure. On the other hand, decentralized committal structures thrive under the conditions of task non-routineness, low task interdependence, and high contributor uncertainty. We conclude with a discussion of results, limitations, and directions for future research."

Developers who participate on multiple projects create ties among projects and facilitate access to those projects‚Äô resources. However, projects also compete for developer attention, and they vary in their ability to integrate knowledge. This paper explores how factors that facilitate knowledge integration (low software coupling and high interactive discussion) impact project success and how developers‚Äô attention to external projects may dampen a focal project‚Äôs success. Further, we explore how these factors may moderate the positive impact of a project‚Äôs network degree centrality to develop a more nuanced model of their influences on project success. Using data from 175 OSS projects we find that software coupling, interactive discussion and externally focused developer attention directly impact completed code commits. Interactive discussion also amplifies the benefit of high network degree centrality, while developers‚Äô external attention weakens the positive impact of high network degree centrality. Results add to theory by providing a more nuanced view of how key strategic resources (knowledge and attention) drive OSS success. In particular it describes how knowledge integration ability, developer attention, and network degree centrality interact to influence project outcomes."
